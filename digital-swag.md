## Digital Swag

Let's get to the good stuff. What swag will be offered at this event and the foreseeable future? Glad you asked!

**A Climate Postive / Carbon Negative Event**

Every email, livestream, and action emits carbon and our goal is for our developer events to be net-zero carbon neutral or carbon negative (even better!). Transparency is key and the Microsoft Developer Relations Event Team is still learning, but we are prioritizing sustainability efforts for our digital experiences. We have partnered with [Tradewater](https://tradewater.us/) to offset the carbon emissions for the event to make it carbon negative!

You can learn more about Tradewater's innovative technology to not only offset large amounts of carbon emissions through organizations or annual household footprints, but even offsetting your footprint from one cup of coffee. You have the power to offset your impact and Tradewater can help. [Learn more about Tradewater](https://tradewater.us/offsetnow/) and ways to get involved - no matter how large or small. Attending this event is a great first step!

**Tech Stretch**

I do not know about you, but I need to get up from my chair, couch, stool and stretch my legs! This tech stretch one-pager is great for taking a quick break from the screen and prioritizing your wellbeing with our guided stretches. [Download and stretch](https://github.com/microsoft/aroundtheclock/blob/main/Tech%20Stretch.jpg) now, later, or daily!

**Digital Kids Pack**

Keeping children engaged is now essential as part of an Events Best Practice. As guardians and self proclaimed coloring and puzzle professionals, we get it. The [Kids Activity Pack](https://workbooks.aaron-powell.com/?WT.mc_id=aroundtheclock-workbooks-cxa) will entertain anyone from 0 to 99 years old, while you attend the event and anytime after. 

No printer and do not want the paper to go to waste? Not a problem! The activity pack is accessible [digitally](https://workbooks.aaron-powell.com/?WT.mc_id=aroundtheclock-workbooks-cxa) to use on any devise!
